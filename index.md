### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because it was the first time we actually made a game. I felt accomplishment as it was something that we can interact with using command-line arguments to play. Something that really stood out to me is how easy it was to make, it required simple math with a couple of if statements. Reflecting back on it now, we can implement a random number generator to generate a different number every time the user plays.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a really interesting lab for me, this lab was the first time I got to write code which read words from a file. It was amazing to see how much can be done with just reading from a file. Many unique ideas and projects can be developed from reading from a file. At first it was challenging for me as I didn't fully understand the concept of reading from a file. After gaining more experience with it and referring back to my notes I have drastically improved.

* Lab 12
    
    Lab 12 part 2 was a really fun lab with an amazing output, after learning about how to make gifs in the lecture, I was confused and doubted that I would be able to do it. After following the directions in the lab, producing a gif was easier than I had imagined. Not only did we produce a gif in part 2, but we also printed out the class name with a moving background. While completing this lab I also felt like it's when I fully understood how the .cc and .h files work. Overall this was my most favorite labs.
